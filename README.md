## Configuration Guide

### Payload Settings

#### Plain Text Mode (Default)
Sends only the URL as `text/plain`:
```
https://example.com/article
```

#### JSON Mode
Sends structured data as `application/json`:
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "title": "Article Title",
  "ts": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "selection": "",
  "source": "chrome-ext"
}
```

**Available Template Placeholders:**
- `{{url}}` - The page URL (cleaned and processed)
- `{{title}}` - Page title
- `{{isoTimestamp}}` - Current timestamp in ISO format
- `{{selection}}` - Selected text (if enabled)
- `{{ogTitle}}` - Open Graph title (if enabled)
- `{{ogType}}` - Open Graph type (if enabled)
- `{{publishedTime}}` - Article published time (if available)
- `{{source}}` - Always "chrome-ext"

### URL Processing

**Use canonical URL from page metadata**
- Detects and uses `<link rel="canonical">` or `og:url` meta tags
- Useful for sites with dynamic URLs

**Strip query parameters**
- Removes tracking parameters like `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`
- Supports wildcards: `utm_*` removes all parameters starting with "utm_"
- Example: `utm_*,fbclid,gclid,ref`

### Additional Data

**Include selected text from page**
- Captures any text selected on the page
- Added to `{{selection}}` placeholder in JSON mode

**Include Open Graph metadata**
- Extracts `og:title`, `og:type`, and `article:published_time`
- Useful for article/blog tracking

### Custom Headers

Add custom HTTP headers to all webhook requests:
- Header name: `X-Custom-Header`
- Header value: `custom-value`

Automatically included headers:
- `Content-Type`: `text/plain` or `application/json`
- `X-Timestamp`: ISO timestamp of request
- `X-Request-ID`: Unique UUID for each request
- `X-Signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature (if HMAC secret configured)

### HMAC Signature

Secure your webhooks with HMAC-SHA256 signatures:

1. Enter a secret key (minimum 16 characters recommended)
2. Save settings
3. Every request will include an `X-Signature` header

**Verify in n8n:**
```javascript
// In your n8n webhook workflow
const receivedSignature = $headers['x-signature'];
const secret = 'your-secret-key';
const body = $body;
const crypto = require('crypto');
const expectedSignature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', secret)
  .update(JSON.stringify(body))
  .digest('hex');

if (receivedSignature !== expectedSignature) {
  throw new Error('Invalid signature');
}
```

## Features in Detail

### Queue Management

When webhook requests fail (network issues, timeouts, server errors), they are automatically queued for retry.

**Viewing Queue:**
- Popup shows: "X items queued for retry"
- Extension badge shows queue count
- Queue limited to 50 items maximum

**Retry Behavior:**
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s
- Maximum 5 retry attempts
- Automatic retry for: 429 (rate limit), 5xx (server errors), network errors, timeouts

**Manual Actions:**
- **Retry Queue**: Manually trigger retry of all queued items
- **Clear Queue**: Remove all queued items (requires confirmation)

### Deduplication

Prevents accidental duplicate sends within 60 seconds.

**How it works:**
1. Send `https://example.com` at 10:00:00
2. Try to send same URL again at 10:00:30 ‚Üí **Blocked** with error: "URL already sent in last 60s"
3. **Force Send Anyway** button appears if you intentionally want to resend
4. After 10:01:00 ‚Üí Can send again normally

### History

View your recent webhook activity in the popup:
- ‚úì Green checkmark = Success (HTTP 200-299)
- ‚úó Red X = Failed (hover for error message)
- Last 5 URLs shown
- Full URL visible on hover

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### ‚ùå "No webhook configured. Click ‚öô to open options and add one."

**Problem:** No webhook has been set up yet.

**Solution:**
1. Click the extension icon
2. Click **Open Settings** button
3. Add a webhook URL and save

---

#### ‚ùå "URL already sent in last 60s"

**Problem:** Duplicate prevention blocked the request.

**Why:** You tried to send the same URL to the same webhook within 60 seconds.

**Solutions:**
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- Click **‚ö† Force Send Anyway** button to bypass deduplication
- This is intentional to prevent accidental double-clicking

---

#### ‚ùå "Cannot send chrome:// or extension URLs"

**Problem:** Trying to send a Chrome internal page or extension page.

**Why:** Chrome internal URLs cannot be sent to external webhooks for security reasons.

**Solution:** This is expected behavior. Only regular web pages (http/https) can be sent.

---

#### ‚ùå "Webhook not found (HTTP 404). Check your webhook URL."

**Problem:** The webhook URL is incorrect or doesn't exist.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your n8n webhook URL is correct
2. Verify the workflow is active in n8n
3. Test the webhook in n8n first
4. Copy the webhook URL again from n8n

---

#### ‚ùå "Webhook authentication failed (HTTP 401/403). Check your credentials."

**Problem:** The webhook requires authentication that isn't configured.

**Solutions:**
1. If your n8n webhook requires authentication, add auth headers in **Custom Headers**
2. Check if your n8n instance requires API keys
3. Verify firewall/network isn't blocking the request

---

#### ‚ùå "Rate limited (HTTP 429). Will retry automatically."

**Problem:** Too many requests sent too quickly.

**Why:** n8n or your server has rate limiting enabled.

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes - the extension will retry automatically
- Reduce frequency of sending URLs
- Check n8n rate limit settings
- Request will retry with exponential backoff

---

#### ‚ùå "Webhook server error (HTTP 500). Will retry automatically."

**Problem:** n8n server or workflow encountered an error.

**Solutions:**
1. Check n8n workflow execution logs
2. Verify workflow logic doesn't have errors
3. Check n8n server status/logs
4. Extension will retry automatically
5. If persists, check n8n community forums

---

#### ‚ùå "Network error. Check your internet connection. Will retry."

**Problem:** Cannot reach the webhook server.

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the webhook URL is accessible (test in browser)
3. Check if VPN/proxy is blocking the request
4. Verify firewall settings
5. Extension will retry automatically when connection restored

---

#### ‚ùå "Request timed out after 10 seconds. Will retry."

**Problem:** Webhook took too long to respond.

**Solutions:**
1. Check n8n server performance/load
2. Optimize workflow in n8n (reduce processing time)
3. Check network latency
4. Extension will retry automatically
5. If workflow needs >10s, consider async processing in n8n

---

#### ‚ùå "Queue is full (50 items max). Please clear queue or wait for retries to complete."

**Problem:** Too many failed requests queued.

**Why:** Maximum queue size (50 items) reached to prevent memory issues.

**Solutions:**
1. Click **Clear Queue** to remove all queued items
2. Click **‚Üª Retry Queue** to process queued items
3. Wait for automatic retries to complete
4. Fix underlying webhook/network issues causing failures

---

#### ‚ùå "Failed permanently after 5 retry attempts"

**Problem:** Request failed and exhausted all retries.

**Why:** Webhook remained unreachable/broken after 5 attempts with exponential backoff.

**Solutions:**
1. Check webhook URL is correct
2. Verify n8n workflow is active and working
3. Test webhook manually in n8n
4. Check n8n server logs for errors
5. Review request in history for specific error details

---

#### ‚ùå "Duplicate webhook name: [name]"

**Problem:** Trying to save two webhooks with the same name.

**Solution:** Give each webhook a unique name.

---

#### ‚ùå "Duplicate webhook URL found. Each webhook must have a unique URL."

**Problem:** Trying to save two webhooks with the same URL.

**Solution:** Each webhook profile must have a different URL.

---

#### ‚ùå "Invalid URL: [name]"

**Problem:** Webhook URL is not a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL.

**Solutions:**
1. URL must start with `http://` or `https://`
2. Check for typos in the URL
3. Copy URL directly from n8n webhook node

---

#### ‚ùå "HMAC secret should be at least 16 characters for security"

**Problem:** HMAC secret is too short.

**Solution:** Use a stronger secret key with at least 16 characters for security.

**Generate strong secret:**
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
openssl rand -hex 32

# Or use password generator
```

---
